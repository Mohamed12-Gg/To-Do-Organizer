# To-Do List Web App

## Project Idea
A simple and clean **To-Do List** web application that helps users manage daily tasks.  
Users can add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as completed, with data saved locally in the browser.

## Features
- Add new tasks
- Mark tasks as completed (with visual strike-through)
- Edit existing tasks
- Delete tasks with confirmation
- Persistent storage using `localStorage`
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: Page structure and layout
- **CSS3**: Styling, layout, and responsiveness
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)**: App logic, DOM manipulation, and localStorage handling
- **Bootstrap (JS bundle)**: Basic responsiveness support

## How It Works
1. User enters a task and clicks **Add**.
2. The task is displayed in a table with Done, Edit, and Delete options.
3. All tasks are saved automatically in the browser's localStorage.
4. On page reload, tasks are restored automatically.

## Usage
Just open `index.html` in any modern web browser — no installation required.
